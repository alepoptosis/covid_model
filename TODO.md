# TO-DO list from code review

- Assign asymptomatic prevalence by age range, like probability of death
- ~~Add protection-compliance to determine what percentage of agents adopts personal protection~~
- ~~Reduce the risk of exposure from agents with personal protection, like for asymptomatics - this implies that PP needs to be extended to all breeds~~
- ~~Add an isolation-compliance-traced for traced contacts~~
- Ensure naming convention is consistent (e.g. test-coverage-sym instead of sym-test-coverage)
- ~~Turn isoltion-threshold into isolation-sym-threhsold to specify measure~~
- ~~Introduce separate isolation duration for contacts vs symptomatics~~
- Find better name for imported-infection (maybe unusual-infection or extraneous-infection)
- ~~Expand countdown names (iso-countdown to isolation-countdown etc.)~~
- ~~Add a neighbours-met-per-day slider and make it so that each agent only interacts with that fixed percentage of their neighbourhood every tick~~
- Test possible ways to only record contacts from x days before
- Test using an external file to set age ranges, their prevalence, and relative asymptomatic percentages and risk of death
- Move threshold calculation from setup-globals to modify-measures so that the threshold is updated as agents die (or could there be a way to only do this when agents die?)
- ~~Introduce an agentset called todays-contacts to slim up the process of counting and recording contacts, and exposing susceptibles. This would be a subset of the neighbours that an agent actually made contact with. The count of contacts would then just be the sum of agentset counts / 2 and would ensure that if an agent is only interacting with a percentage of its neighbourhood, that the agents chosen are consistent throughout a tick.~~
- Find a name for the random duration of the period between incubation and development of symptoms
- ~~Change contact lists to agentsets~~
- ~~Instead of using a random p value and comparing it to the parameter value, use n-of where n is the number of agents calculated from the % compliance for that measure (e.g. lockdown or shielding)~~ (doesn't support floats, left old system in place)
- Explain to the user that the order of procedures in modify-measures is critical to ensure that lockdown and shielding don't release agents that are being isolated for other reasons (i.e. isolation of symptomatics and test and trace)
- Make the isolate procedure less convoluted
- ~~Prevent the while loop of the normal distribution from looping infinitely~~
